Our clients range from FTSE 300 companies, to large charitable organisations and some small local businesses who are striving to expand. Most of our clients use our Data Analysis service to inform their strategic decision making and their targets for the immediate, mid-term and long-term future. The data sources that we use for this type of analysis include customer enquiry data, sales figures, costs, market data and customer feedback.
